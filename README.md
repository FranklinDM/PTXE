# Periodic Table of XUL Elements (PTXE)
This extension contains a collection of XUL demos that used to be available as a web page, but can no longer be viewed in browsers since support for Remote XUL was disabled.

The content of this extension is based on the work of [Alice Corbin](https://github.com/alijc). The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/alijc/xul-periodic-table).

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

## Download
Check the releases page of this repository.
