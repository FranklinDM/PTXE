# XUL Periodic Table
This extension contains a collection of XUL demos that used to be available as a web page, but can no longer be viewed in browsers since support for Remote XUL was disabled.

The contents of these demos are based on the work of [Ali Corbin](https://github.com/alijc), the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/alijc/xul-periodic-table).

## Building
